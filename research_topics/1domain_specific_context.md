# Domain Specific MultiAgent System

Lots of research focus on assistant agent. But we should seriously consider develop agentic systems that can automatically complete tasks with almost no human involved in mid-steps.

## Enhance Domain Context Understanding and Following

### Background

Lots of research that enhance LLM's domain knowledge ability. focus on 1) pretraining LLM with domain knowledge, 2) post fine tuning LLM models with domain knowledge, 3) prompt with domain knowledge.... In our understanding, the LLM's powerful domain knowledge understanding ability is for agentic workflow integration. So for a agentic domain specialist system, we need to pay attention to new ways to advance LLM's domain task completion ability.

### Review of Methods
One of the way is through Prompt optimization. 

One way is Context engineering. Memory management. 

One way is through Domain specific tool use. ToolUniverse.

One way is through domain programming language generation and execution.

One way is build higher level Routing structure. 

One way is formally verify the result before final report.

## Domain Agent Synthesizer Framework
In our research, we propose a domain sub-agent synthesizer and optimizer, as well as a Specialist Agent Market. That each Agent will be trained in a RL at inference setting until it mastered some domain tasks. We build a interface that the Agent configuration is easily called. We understand that the Agent is another layer in advancing LLM's domain task completion ability.
