# agent-market

when we are provided too many tools, LLMs will not be able to manage such huge number of tool-descriptions.

One way is to add a tool-selection agent, or tool mapping tool. But that's not the point.

What we should do, is create routine, that given a bigger task, we first decompose the task to smaller sub-tasks, then dispatch the sub-tasks to specific agent that already worked well on sub-tasks.
